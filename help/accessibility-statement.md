# Accessibility statement

This accessibility statement applies to the present [OA.Report](https://oa.report) website and excludes other product websites ([OAbutton.org](https://oabutton.org/), [InstantILL.org](https://instantill.org/), [ShareYourPaper.org](https://shareyourpaper.org/)), our [main website](https://oa.works), and our [blog](https://blog.oa.works/).

This website is run by OA.Works. Our organization is committed to accessibility and inclusivity for all people with disabilities. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* Zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen.
* Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
* Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.
* Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).

We’ve also made the website text easy to understand using Simple English (US).

We continue to improve the website’s accessibility and performance for as many devices as possible. We do not, however, support Internet Explorer.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

### Measures to support accessibility

OA.Works takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of the OA.Report website:

* Included accessibility throughout our internal policies.
* Appointed an accessibility officer.
* Assigned accessibility goals and responsibilities.

### Conformance status

OA.Works is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d).

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

OA.Works’ website is **partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA**. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
