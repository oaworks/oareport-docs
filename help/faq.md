# FAQ

## How do I know if you're missing something?

We probably are, it's nearly impossible to find everything. If you're on our paid plan, we can ensure that we’re ingesting sources that matter to you to ensure we have good coverage. If you’d like to compare our results to others, try Lens or OpenAlex.

## What formats of data can you ingest?

CSV is great and JSON is good. The best option is whichever format is quick and easy for you to share. We'll take it from there.
