# Your account

When you sign up for OA.Report, we'll send you a “magic” login link that allows anyone who clicks it to access [private parts of ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]your report, including insights, in-depth analytics, and strategies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep your login link safe and only share it with people you trust.
{% endhint %}

You can log in as many devices as you want with your login link. Multiple people can also use this link. They won’t need a username or password, and you won't need to authorize their accounts. This makes it easy to give access to your report at your institution securely. Users can log out at any point, and your access will expire after one year.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to change your login link, [get in touch](mailto:joe@oa.works).
{% endhint %}
