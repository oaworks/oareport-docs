# Data sources

OA.reports builds on open data like OpenAlex, Crossref, and ShareYourPaper. In our paid plans, we can ingest the institution's internal data, and collect our own to help power more insights and strategies.

## Institution's data

We can collect data from a wide variety of institution-specific sources, including:

* Grant reporting systems
* Grant databases
* Compliance tracking systems
* Financial systems
* Paid invoices
* Publisher payment dashboards

We publish the data we collect from these sources as open data, unless asked not to.

## Data we create

Some data is not readily available anywhere, so we can collect it. For instance,

* Institutions publishing output on preprint servers (e.g BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Research Square, SSRN) and other poorly indexed locations
* Corresponding author email addresses
* If articles have data availability statements
* If articles have open data or code (with support from Dataseer)
* Submitted/accepted dates

We publish the data we collect from these sources as open data.
