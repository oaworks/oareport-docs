# FAQ

## How do I report errors or give feedback?

Whatever works for you! You can send us an email, a spreadsheet with comments, or something. What's most important is a clear description of what's wrong, what you expect, and an example or two.

## How do I know if you're missing something?

We probably are, it's nearly impossible to find everything. However, if you're on our paid plan we can make sure we're ingesting sources that matter to you to ensure we have good coverage. If you'd like to compare our results to others, try Lens or OpenAlex.

## What formats of data can you ingest?

CSV is great, JSON is good, and the best option is whatever is quick and easy for you to share. We'll take it from there.
