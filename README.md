[OA.Report](https://oa.report/) identifies research outputs organizations have supported, analyzes their openness (including OA policy compliance), and then streamlines taking action to make results more open. It's simple, free to use, and open source!

## Funding

OA.Report was built in [partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://blog.oa.works/grant-to-bolster-oa-policies-from-bmgf/). We've also received [grant support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](https://blog.oa.works/grant-from-robert-wood-johnson-foundation/) and [Arcadia](https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/).

## Built at OA.Works

OA.Report is built by OA.Works, a non-profit project building tools so that Open Access is easy and equitable.
